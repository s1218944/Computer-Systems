# Chapter 1 A Tour of Computer Systems

## 1.1 

ASCII is used for most computer systems to represent text character.
All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits.

## 1.2

For a hello.c program, in order to run on a system, the individual C statements should be translated by other programs into a sequence of low-level machine-language instructions. Then the instructions are packaged into an executable object program also called executable object files. The translation from source file to object file is performed by compiler driver:

          _ _ _ _ _ _ _
hello.c   | pre-      |
--------> | processor |
source    | (cpp)     |
program   |_ _ _ _ _ _|
